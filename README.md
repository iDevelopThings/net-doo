1. Create categories index page where you can search for the specific category you want ( possible alpine js component )
2. Create categories create page where you can : [
    1. add categories and an representation image for that specific category or change it if one is selected and you pick another the last one gets presented
    2. Modify current category parents and add or remove some
    3. Modify and change category children and also view all
    4. Change the name of the category
]

3. Create categories edit page where you can do the same as in create
4. Create categories delete function ( admin only! ) -> run throught middleware and gates


Notes + ideas: 

    1. Maybe on the categories add some chartjs stuff to display top 5 categories by sales
    2. Regarding 1 in this list maybe when you want to view products for that category start displaying by sold or popularity of the customers

Products should be sortable by category, manufacturer and both
